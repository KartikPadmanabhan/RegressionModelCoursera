# HTML Rendering

We make use of bootstrap to add beauty to html report. To install bootstrap please install it the following way:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('rstudio/rmarkdown')
install.packages('knitr', repos = c('http://rforge.net', 'http://cran.rstudio.org'),
                 type = 'source')
install_github('jimhester/knitrBootstrap')
```

To knit an Rmd file to use with bootstrap in order to generate the html report as shown in the project report please do something like this from rstudio:

```
knit_bootstrap('mtcars.Rmd')
options(rstudio.markdownToHTML =
            function(inputFile, outputFile) {
                require(knitrBootstrap)
                knit_bootstrap_md(input=inputFile, output=outputFile)
            }
)
```

## Project Goal 

Take the mtcars data set and write up an analysis to answer their question using regression models and exploratory data analyses.

Your report must be:

    Written as a PDF printout of a compiled (using knitr) R markdown document.
        Do not use any packages that are not in R-base or the library datasets.
    Brief. Roughly the equivalent of 2 pages or less for the main text. Supporting figures in an appendix can be included up to 5 total pages including the 2 for the main report. The appendix can only include figures.
    Include a first paragraph executive summary.

Upload your PDF by clicking the Upload button below the text box.

Peer Grading

    The criteria that your classmates will use to evaluate and grade your work are shown below. 
    Each criteria is binary: (1 point = criteria met acceptably; 0 points = criteria not met acceptably)
    Your Course Project score will be the sum of the points and will count as 40% of your final grade in the course.
